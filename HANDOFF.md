## 2026-09-28 — Muse: pre-existing a11y failure needs a fix (not from the permissions feature)

**What:** the accessibility script fails 2–3 checks on the client page tab strip at 200% text size.
The "More" overflow button renders wider than the 1280px viewport (WCAG 1.4.10 reflow):

- `device text-200 avery #/client/<id>/referrals` — `div.tabs-more-wrap (1294px > 1280px)`, `button.tabs-more (1294px > 1280px)`
- `device text-200 avery #/client/<id>/budget` — same, 1297px
- `office text-200 mrivera #/client/<id>/budget` — same, intermittent

**Evidence it's pre-existing:** reproduced identically on pure v1.14.1 (tag `v1.14.1`, commit
`fa94736`) — same checks, same pixel values. `public/views/client.js` and `clients.js` are
byte-identical between v1.14.1 and the merged tree; the permissions feature touched nothing
tab-related.

**Repro:** `SCRIPTS="accessibility" bash scripts/ui/run-all.sh` (~13 min; needs
`playwright@1.56.1` + `axe-core@4.13.0`). The seed is deterministic (seedValue 42), so the avery
failures should reproduce; the mrivera one is flaky.

**Release impact:** did not block 1.15.0 — CI's browser job went green. But it's a genuine reflow
failure, worth fixing properly rather than loosening the check.

## 2026-09-28 — Muse: 1.15.0 shipped

- Admin-managed per-user permission overrides is released: branch
  `feature/admin-managed-permissions`, PR #39, release commit `27cac31`, tag `v1.15.0`, live on
  the Pages site.
- Six roles stay as defaults; per-user grant/deny table (`user_permission_overrides`, migration
  **48** — renumbered, v1.14.1 already used 46/47); deny wins; effective permissions recomputed per
  request; audit-logged admin UI; `GET /api/me`; deny-aware `can()` in app and kernel.
- Released under a recorded policy exception (feature release 34h after 1.14.0; a patch cannot
  carry migration 48 + 5 new routes). Exception text is at the top of the GitHub Release notes.
- Deliberate limitation: overrides don't sync office↔device — syncing them needs a design for
  direction, conflict handling, and authorization (privilege-escalation risk if done naively).
